# Personal Site Design

## Primary Purpose
    The Primary purpose of my website will be to showcase what I have learned at EDA through html and css, and also to blog about the experience as it happens.

## Target Audience
    The Target audience will be people wanting to see my html and css capability and read about my time at EDA.


## How Will Visitors Interact?
    Visitors will interact with the site by having a pleasant user experience, not only visually but finding it easy to get around and find the information they want to see.


## How will you build your site?
    I will build the site firstly by planning how I want it to look, and then using the appropriate html and css to bring it to life! Incorporating my own knowledge of html and css, a frame work and a bit of research.
